SYNTICATE is a CG Art Direction studio.

We produce high quality Computer Graphics for TV & Internet commercials. Our team has an English speaking producers and talented Art Directors as well as a creative unit. It helps us to develop 3d videos from zero including cg directing and creative concept development. Our second main advantage is the ability to integrate computer graphics into the filmed shots.

We have synthesis in our DNA, we synthesize all types of CGI, from character animation to motion graphics, but what remains constant is our aspiration for the future.
